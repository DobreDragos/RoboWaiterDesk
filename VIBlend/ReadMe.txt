How to install VIBlend Controls for WinForms to Visual Studio Toolbox?

The installation tries to add VIBlend Controls for WinForms to your Visual Studio 2008, Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2012 and Visual Studio 2013 toolbox automatically.

If you do not see any VIBlend controls in your toolbox after the installation, then you will have to add them manually by following these instructions:
