 - HierarchyItemMouseDoubleClick

We also added several improvements in the in-place cell editors' infrastructure. Specifically we added the following activation and deactivation events:
 - Click on selected cell (MOUSE_CLICK_SELECTED_CELL)
 - Enter key activation (KEY_PRESS_ENTER
 - Esc key deactivation (KEY_PRESS_ESC)

The default activation and deactivation flags for the built-in cell editors where modified to use the new activation events.

Please, note that these are breaking changes. If you are using an earlier version of VIBlend Controls for Windows Forms you will have to make minor changes to your code.

New in version 4.6 are the HierarchyItems and Cells selection changed events:
